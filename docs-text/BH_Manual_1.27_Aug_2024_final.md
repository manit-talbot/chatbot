#### **Introduction**

The Ohio Department of Medicaid (ODM) created this manual to help providers of community behavioral health services understand coverage and reimbursement for services provided under the fee-for-service programs. Medicaid managed care entities (MCEs) also cover services described in this manual. Providers should refer to the MCE's [billing manual](https://managedcare.medicaid.ohio.gov/providers/provider-contracting-information) for specific information. For purposes of this manual, community behavioral health providers are those who are certified by the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (OhioMHAS) as described in Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) rule 5160- 27-01. The Ohio Administrative Code contains specific regulatory information that is the basis for the information contained in this manual.

All provider enrollment applications must be submitted using Ohio Medicaid's Provider Network Management (PNM) module. The PNM module is the single point for providers to complete provider enrollment, centralized credentialing, and provider self-service. For more information about the PNM please visit [www.managedcare.medicaid.ohio.gov/managed-care/centralized-credentialing.](http://www.managedcare.medicaid.ohio.gov/managed-care/centralized-credentialing)

# <span id="page-11-0"></span>Provider Type 84 or 95

Prior to enrollment in the Ohio Medicaid program, a provider must be certified by OhioMHAS as a provider of behavioral health (BH) services. Information on OhioMHAS's service certification can be obtained from the OhioMHAS Bureau of Licensure & Certification by calling 614-752-8880 or by visiting the OhioMHAS licensure and certification webpage here: [Licensure & Certification | Department](https://mha.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/mha/supporting-providers/licensure-and-certification)  [of Mental Health and Addiction Services \(ohio.gov\).](https://mha.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/mha/supporting-providers/licensure-and-certification)

Once certified by OhioMHAS as a BH service provider, an online application or applications for enrollment in the Ohio Medicaid program must be submitted using the PNM module. There are two provider types associated with behavioral health benefits; provider type 84 is used for accessing the mental health benefit while provider type 95 is used for accessing the substance use disorder benefit. Organizations that will be providing both benefits will need to enroll as **BOTH** provider types. There may be an application fee for applying as provider type 84 and/or 95. During the enrollment process, a provider specialty will need to be selected for each provider type. ODM will add or change specialties as necessary based upon the OhioMHAS/SAMHSA certification(s) and/or OhioMHAS licensure documentation received with the application.

For more information about enrolling as a Medicaid provider, please visit the following link: <https://managedcare.medicaid.ohio.gov/managed-care/centralized-credentialing/about-pnm>

# <span id="page-11-1"></span>Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Clinics (RHCs)

FQHCs and RHCs may be certified by OhioMHAS for the provision of community behavioral health services by enrolling as a provider type 84 and/or 95. OAC Rule [5160-28-03](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-administrative-code/rule-5160-28-03) describes requirements for FQHC and RHC services, including services that are considered FQHC and RHC Prospective Payment System (PPS) services. For OhioMHAS-certified providers who are also FQHCs or RHCs, behavioral health services that are not FQHC or RHC PPS services are covered under [OAC Chapter 27](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-administrative-code/chapter-5160-27) and may be billed under their Ohio Medicaid Provider type 84 or 95 enrollment and will be paid in accordance with [OAC Chapter 27](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-administrative-code/chapter-5160-27) as described in this manual.

#### <span id="page-11-2"></span>Out of State MH/SUD Providers

Pursuant to Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) rule [5160-27-01,](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-administrative-code/rule-5160-27-01) MH and/or SUD agencies/programs operating outside of the state of Ohio must be recognized (regulated) in the state in which it operates as a provider of community-based MH and/or SUD services. That documentation must be submitted along with the organization's Medicaid provider application.

# <span id="page-11-3"></span>Rendering Practitioners

ODM requires that the rendering practitioner for behavioral health services be listed on claims submitted to Ohio Medicaid for payment. Their personal NPI must be reported in the rendering field on the claim for each service they provide.

All rendering practitioners are required to have a National Provider Identifier (NPI) to render services to Medicaid enrollees AND they will be required to enroll in the Ohio Medicaid program and affiliate with their employing/contracting agency. An NPI can be obtained by visiting [https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/NPPES.](https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/NPPES)

Once the provider has obtained an NPI, they must visit the PNM and enroll as a provider in the Ohio Medicaid Program. More details on this process are available at: <https://managedcare.medicaid.ohio.gov/managed-care/centralized-credentialing/about-pnm>

#### <span id="page-12-0"></span>Paraprofessionals

Paraprofessionals (practitioners without a professional license) may render some mental health and/or SUD services. They must enroll in Ohio Medicaid following the instructions above. The provider type in Ohio's PNM system is "96". Paraprofessionals may select more than one specialty. For example, one could enroll as a Qualified Mental Health Specialist (QMHS) and may also enroll as a Care Management Specialist (CMS) by selecting specialties 960 (QMHS) and 962 (CMS).

If a QMHS or CMS practitioner obtains additional educational credentials or years of experience after their initial enrollment, the employing/contracting agency should provide documentation of the educational credential or experience by submitting a provider update to the ODM Provider Enrollment mailbox: [medicaid\\_provider\\_update@medicaid.ohio.gov.](mailto:medicaid_provider_update@medicaid.ohio.gov) Once the documentation has been received and approved, the provider's enrollment status will be updated to match. (See more information below about QMHS, CMS and Certified Peer Supporters ).

# <span id="page-12-1"></span>Multi-licensed Practitioners

ODM recognizes that some individuals may hold more than one (1) license or an assistant/trainee credential with differing scopes of practice. In order to allow these practitioners to operate under the scope of multiple professional credentials, ODM is allowing these practitioners to add a multi-license specialty. This multi-license specialty will allow the practitioner to render services available under their second license or credential. Please refer to the Dual Licensure Grid located at <https://medicaid.ohio.gov/resources-for-providers/bh/manuals> under the Billing Resources section.

#### To enroll with multi-license specialty:

If a practitioner has more than one credential/paraprofessional recognition, please include a comment in the Notes section of the enrollment application indicating what additional credential/paraprofessional recognition is held. Paraprofessionals can select a primary, a secondary or multiple secondary specialty. Be certain to upload the necessary documentation for each license/certificate. If already enrolled with ODM, email [medicaid\\_provider\\_update@medicaid.ohio.gov](mailto:medicaid_provider_update@medicaid.ohio.gov) with necessary information to support the second specialty.

#### Claim submission:

- **Reporting additional licensure on claims** Practitioners with the multi‐licensed practitioner specialty submit claims as follows:
  - o For their original license according to information found elsewhere in this manual: rendering NPI, applicable procedure modifiers, etc.
  - o For services under their additional license(s), the claims will require an additional modifier to reflect under what additional license they are operating.
  - o For example, a person enrolled with ODM as an RN who is also an LPCC must have the UH modifier **in addition to their individual practitioner NPI** on the detail line of the claim in order for ODM's claims payment system to recognize this practitioner as an allowable renderer of the service.

<span id="page-12-2"></span>See the "Modifiers" tab on the Dual Licensure Grid referenced above.

# <span id="page-15-0"></span>**Overview of Supervision**

Ohio Medicaid covers services provided by practitioners who, under state licensing, require supervision. The types of practitioners who may supervise are determined according to the appropriate licensing boards.

**General supervision:** The supervising practitioner must be available by telephone to provide assistance and direction if needed.

**Direct supervision:** The supervising practitioner must be "immediately available" and "interruptible" to provide assistance and direction throughout the performance of the procedure; however, he or she does not need to be present in the room when the procedure is performed.

Ohio Medicaid requires the following practitioners to practice under either direct or general supervision. Reporting the supervising NPI on the claim is optional. For those practitioners listed below with direct supervision, the service will be paid at direct supervisor's rate when supervisor NPI is included in the header of the claim. If the supervisor NPI is not included on the claim indicating the service is provided under general supervision, the service will be paid at 72.25% of maximum fee.

# <span id="page-16-0"></span>**Table 1-2: Supervision for Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) Codes**

Practitioners requiring supervision must have supervision available to them at all times, including supervisor sick days, trainings, vacations, etc. Each licensing board regulates supervision requirements for their provider types and may have specific requirements pertaining to supervisor coverage during absences. In the absence of board guidance on supervisor coverage, Ohio Medicaid does not require practitioners to be assigned to a specific supervisor, therefore, any qualified supervising practitioner permitted by the practitioner's respective licensing board's OAC may provide coverage during absences but must assume all supervision responsibilities, including signing off on services provided. The following websites contain further guidance on supervision:

- State Medical Board of Ohio- <http://med.ohio.gov/>
- Ohio Board of Nursing <http://www.nursing.ohio.gov/>
- Counselor, Social Worker and Marriage and Family Therapist Board <https://cswmft.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/cswmft/home>
- Ohio Chemical Dependency Professionals Board <http://ocdp.ohio.gov/>
- Ohio Board of Psychology <http://psychology.ohio.gov/>

\*This is a brief overview concerning licensure and scope of practice. It is each agency or provider's responsibility to understand the laws, rules, and requirements applicable to their licensure and scope of practice.

# <span id="page-16-1"></span>**Incident to Services**

The term "incident to" refers to the services or supplies that are a key part of the physician's personal professional services in the course of diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury. In plain language: under the "incident to" provision of Medicare, services are submitted under the physician's NPI but are actually performed by someone else. There are restrictions on the types of services that ancillary personnel may perform under this provision. Ohio Medicaid follows the CMS guidelines on "incident to" services. More information is available in [The "Incident To" Provision of Medicare Fact Sheet.](https://cgsmedicare.com/partb/mr/pdf/incident_to_provision_factsheet.pdf)

Additional Resources for CMS "incident to" billing information:

- [Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15 Section 60.1](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/bp102c15.pdf)

# <span id="page-17-0"></span>**Practitioner Modifiers**

In order to communicate detailed information in an efficient, standardized way, modifiers are twocharacter suffixes that healthcare providers or coders attach to a CPT or HCPCS code to provide additional information about the practitioner or procedure. It is extremely important to accurately report modifiers as they are used to count towards soft limits, price services, and adjudicate claims appropriately. Modifiers are always two characters in length. They may consist of two numbers, two letters, or a combination of a letter and a number (alphanumeric). Ohio Medicaid will accept modifiers in any order, however, modifier fields on the claim must be populated in order from one to four (the first modifier field must be populated before the second modifier field, etc.).

# **Table 1-3: Practitioner Modifiers**

\*For fee for service, these modifiers are optional except when the rendering practitioner holds multilicense specialties and is rendering a service only available under a secondary license/certificate. Additional modifiers (HM, HN, HO, and UK) to designate education level are required for services as listed in this table. For information on MCE requirements, please refer to the applicable MCE manual.

#### **Table 1-4: Procedure Modifiers**

#### <span id="page-19-0"></span>**Place of Service (POS)**

Providers must accurately identify and report on each claim detail line where a service took place using the most appropriate [CMS place of service code.](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/place-of-service-codes/Place_of_Service_Code_Set) Each billing chart in this manual will list the place of service codes covered by Medicaid.

#### **"Other Place of Service" Setting**

Place of service "99-Other Place of Service" has been redefined for Ohio Medicaid as "Community". See this manual's Appendix for a more complete definition of this and other places of service.

### <span id="page-19-1"></span>**Claims Detail Rollup for Same Day Services**

When the same service is rendered to the same client by the same practitioner at more than one time during the same day, those services should be "rolled up" into a single detail line on a claim. However, if anything differs except the time the service was rendered, the claims should be reported separately. Services that need to be rolled must be rolled by the same date of service, same client, same HCPCS code, same modifier(s), same individual rendering practitioner NPI, same supervisor NPI, and same place of service. Services that are not appropriately rolled up may result in a denial for duplicate services.

**Example 1**: Amy Smith, RN renders TBS to a client in the office in the morning and then again in the office later that afternoon. This is acceptable to roll up the two patient contacts into the same claim line because there is the same service, the same rendering practitioner, the same client, and the same place of service.

**Example 2:** Amy Smith, RN renders TBS to a client in the office in the morning and then again in the client's home later that afternoon. The services should be reported on separate detail lines with appropriate place of service identifying home or office.

# <span id="page-19-2"></span>**Third Party Payer (TPP) Coordination of Benefits (COB)**

Coordination of benefits is the process of determining the payment obligations of each health plan, insurance policy, or third-party resource when two or more resources cover the same benefits for a Medicaid recipient. Coordination of benefits is a federal requirement set forth in 42 CFR 433 Subpart D and includes specific activities for state Medicaid agencies related to third-party liability (TPL). Medicaid, or a Medicaid Managed Care Entity (MCE) must be the payer of last resort, except as allowed in OAC rules 5160-1-08 and 5160-26-09.1.

After a provider has gone through all reasonable measures to obtain all third-party payments as described in OAC rules [5160-1-08](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-administrative-code/rule-5160-1-08) and [5160-26-09.1](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-administrative-code/rule-5160-26-09.1) a claim may be submitted to ODM/MCEs requesting reimbursement for the rendered service(s). Providers who have received a zero payment from a thirdparty payer (TPP) or a partial payment will need to use the appropriate claim adjustment reason codes (CARCs) from the primary's Explanation of Benefits (EOB) on the claim submission to ODM/MCEs.

ODM maintains a list of specific service procedure codes or combinations of procedure codes and rendering providers that are covered by Ohio Medicaid but are not generally covered by commercial payers or Medicare. This list, known as the *Medicare and TPL list* is located at <https://medicaid.ohio.gov/resources-for-providers/bh/manuals> under *Billing Resources/Medicare and TPL Bypass list*. The list is separated into three sections – Medicare, Medicare Opioid Treatment Program (OTP), and TPL Bypass (for commercial payers).

• The Medicare list includes procedure codes and procedures code/rendering provider type combinations not covered by Medicare. The Medicare OTP list is only applicable to opioid treatment providers serving individuals with Medicare coverage.

• The TPL Bypass list is applicable to other payers (other than Medicare or Medicaid payers). For the procedure codes on each of these payer lists, respectively, the provider may "bypass" the requirement to first bill the Third Party Payer (commercial or Medicare payer) and submit the claim directly to Medicaid.

The *Medicare and TPL Bypass List* was created to allow payment for certain services ODM identified that are not typically covered by TPPs. However, if TPP coverage is later discovered through ODM's or an MCE's post payment recovery process, payment may be recouped in accordance with federal Medicaid requirements. Therefore, if a provider is unsure of a specific TPP's coverage policy for any of the services or procedure codes, the provider should confirm coverage prior to billing for the service directly to Medicaid to avoid a future recoupment. , The Bypass List will be periodically updated to account for Medicare and commercial insurance coverage changes.

The *Medicare and TPL Bypass List* only applies to claims submitted by Medicaid provider types 84 (Community Mental Health Agencies) and 95 (Substance Use Disorder Treatment Providers). ODM recommends:

- BH providers require individuals to provide TPP information at the time of service as a best practice.
- BH providers should use the Electronic Data Interchange 270/271 eligibility transaction, check the payer portal, and exhaust any other sources for any TPP information on file, prior to submitting a claim to Medicaid.
- BH providers are required to bill the TPP prior to billing Medicaid for all services except for the service procedure codes listed on the *BH Medicare and TPL Bypass List*.
- <span id="page-20-0"></span>• BH providers should always notify ODM when they identify incorrect TPL information.

# **Benefits and Prior Authorization**

<span id="page-20-1"></span>In the behavioral health benefit package, there are services and/or levels of care that are subject to prior authorization. Table 1-5 summarizes those services/levels of care and their associated prior authorization policy. Certain services may have prior authorization requirements when provided on the same day as other services.

#### <span id="page-22-1"></span>**Fraud, Waste, and Abuse**

OAC rule [5160-1-29](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-administrative-code/rule-5160-1-29) sets forth the Ohio Medicaid policy on Medicaid Fraud, Waste, and Abuse. Under the Ohio Medicaid provider agreement, providers are required to comply with the terms of the agreement, Ohio Revised Code, Administrative Code, and federal statutes and rules. In Ohio, the Attorney General is authorized under ORC 109.85 to create a Medicaid Fraud and Control Unit (MFCU) for investigating and prosecuting Medicaid provider fraud in Ohio. Additional information regarding Ohio's Medicaid Fraud Control unit can be found on their website, Health Care Fraud - [Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost.](https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/About-AG/Service-Divisions/Health-Care-Fraud)

#### <span id="page-23-0"></span>**Review of Provider Records**

OAC rule [5160-1-27](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-administrative-code/rule-5160-1-27) sets forth the Ohio Medicaid policy on Review of Provider Records. Please review this rule for more information about Ohio Medicaid audit and review activities.

#### <span id="page-23-1"></span>**Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM)**

The CMS Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) program measures and reports improper payments in Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Please visit CMS's [PERM website](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/monitoring-programs/medicaid-and-chip-compliance/perm/providers) for more information.

# <span id="page-23-2"></span>**Medicaid National Correct Coding Initiative**

The National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) was established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to promote national correct coding methodologies with the goal to reduce improper coding that results in inappropriate payments for both Medicare and Medicaid. A complete and up-to-date list of NCCI edits can be found at [https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-integrity/national](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-integrity/national-correct-coding-initiative/medicaid-ncci-edit-files/index.html)[correct-coding-initiative/medicaid-ncci-edit-files/index.html.](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-integrity/national-correct-coding-initiative/medicaid-ncci-edit-files/index.html) These edits are updated quarterly.

NCCI procedure-to-procedure (PTP) edits and medically unlikely edits (MUEs) are only applicable to a single provider to a single individual on the same date of service. NCCI contains two types of edits:

#### <span id="page-23-3"></span>NCCI Procedure-To-Procedure (PTP) Edits

PTP edits define pairs of Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) / Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes that should not be reported together for a variety of reasons. The purpose of the PTP edits is to prevent improper payments when incorrect code combinations are reported.

**Example 1**: The same physician performs a psychotherapy service and Evaluation and Management (E&M) service on the same day for the same client (significant and separately identifiable services). NCCI will not allow the psychotherapy code 90834 to be billed with an E&M office visit code 99212, as there are separate add-on codes (+90833, +90836, and +90838) for psychotherapy services provided in conjunction with E&M services.

**Example 2:** A qualified practitioner working for ABC Behavioral Health Agency renders 90791, a psychiatric diagnostic assessment, for a client. On the same day, the same client receives an "evaluation and management" primary care service (e.g. 99202-99205) rendered by another qualified practitioner working for ABC Behavioral Health Agency. According to the NCCI practitioner to practitioner (PTP) edit guidance, this is acceptable because in this scenario, the services were rendered by two different rendering practitioners. The NCCI PTP edits apply only to the same practitioner.

Medicaid PTP, MUE edits, and other relevant information can be found at: [https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-integrity/ncci/edit-files/index.html.](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-integrity/ncci/edit-files/index.html)

For PTP edits that have a Correct Coding Modifier Indicator (CCMI) of "0," the codes should never be reported together by the same provider for the same individual on the same date of service. If they are reported on the same date of service, the column one code is eligible for payment and the column two code is denied.

For PTP edits that have a CCMI of "1," the codes may be reported together only in defined circumstances which are identified on the claim by the use of specific NCCI-associated modifiers. Where services are

"separate and distinct," it may be necessary to override the procedure-to-procedure edit using a specific modifier:

- XE "Separate encounter, A service that is distinct because it occurred during a separate encounter" (This modifier should only be used to describe separate encounters on the same date of service).
- XS "Separate Structure, A service that is distinct because it was performed on a separate organ/structure."
- XP "Separate Practitioner, A service that is distinct because it was performed by a different practitioner."
- XU "Unusual Non-Overlapping Service, The use of a service that is distinct because it does not overlap usual components of the main service."

Documentation must support a different session, different procedure or surgery, different site or organ system, separate incision/excision, separate lesion, or separate injury (or area of injury in extensive injuries) not ordinarily encountered or performed on the same day by the same individual. However, when another already established modifier is appropriate, it should be used rather than modifier 59. Modifier 59 should only be utilized if no other more specific modifier is appropriate.

# <span id="page-24-0"></span>Medically Unlikely Edits (MUEs)

MUEs define for each HCPCS / CPT code the maximum units of service (UOS) that a provider would report under most circumstances for a single individual on a single date of service. **MUEs cannot be overridden with the 59, XE, XS, XP, XU modifiers.**

Example 1: The same physician performs two diagnostic evaluations (2 units of 90791) to the same client on the same day. NCCI will deny the second evaluation, as it is medically unlikely that one client would need two complete diagnostic evaluations in the same day.

There is extensive guidance regarding Medicaid agencies and national correct coding available at [The](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-integrity/ncci/index.html)  [National Correct Coding Initiative in Medicaid.](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-integrity/ncci/index.html)

# <span id="page-25-0"></span>**Time-Based CPT Codes**

When billing time-based codes, the CPT/HCPCS time rule applies, unless otherwise specified: For the minimum billable service of the code, divide the time by two and add one minute in order to determine if that code can be billed. For example; 90832 = 30 minutes, therefore the minimum length of service must be 16 minutes (30/2 = 15 then 15 + 1 = 16) in order for the service to be billable.

Effective January 1, 2023, the American Medical Association (AMA) discontinued prolonged service codes 99354 and 99355 for use with psychotherapy codes. ODM and MCE billing systems were updated to reflect this change. Providers should refer to AMA and National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) guidance with regard to billing psychotherapy codes for dates of service on or after January 1, 2023.

Effective January 1, 2022, ODM adopted for Medicaid community behavioral health providers the use of AMA procedure codes of 99415 and 99416 to indicate prolonged E&M services. Providers should refer to the CPT manual for additional information about appropriate use of codes 99415 and 99416.

Also effective January 1, 2022, ODM's claims payment system was updated to follow NCCI Procedure to Procedure (PTP) edits to not allow the use of 99354 and 99355 with E&M codes 99202-99205 and 99211-99215.

Providers serving individuals with primary insurance coverage other than Medicaid are advised to follow billing guidance for the primary payer when determining which prolonged services code to use before submitting to Medicaid for secondary payment.

For more information regarding prolonged services codes, please review the prolonged services section of the latest edition of the CPT manual. The CPT website can be found [here.](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/cpt)

#### **Behavioral Health Services**

For behavioral health billing, CPT service codes consist of E&M office visits, psychotherapy, psychiatric diagnostic evaluations, psychiatric testing, and appropriate add-on codes. The American Medical Association (AMA) publishes annual CPT reference books, which provide the CPT l codes, their associated descriptions, and guidance on appropriate use, including use of add-on codes. Please note, providers are responsible for utilizing the appropriate AMA and/or CMS guidance for documentation and billing. Therefore, it is recommended that all providers obtain a copy of a current CPT manual and, for those providers/practitioners that participate in the Original Medicare program, the most current guidance is available through th[e Medicare Learning Network \(MLN\).](https://www.cms.gov/outreach-and-education/medicare-learning-network-mln/mlngeninfo) This section also includes billing guidance for HCPCS codes that are also available to both MH and SUD agencies. Practitioner abbreviations are used in the service tables provided in the remaining sections of this manual. The *Practitioner Abbreviations Key* below may be used as a reference to these abbreviations.

**Table 2-3 Evaluation and Management Office Visit - Report of Pregnancy**

HCPCS code T1023 is to be used for a "Report of Pregnancy" (ROP). Payment may be made for one report of a pregnancy diagnosed in conjunction with an E&M service that is not associated with a normal obstetrics/gynecology visit. The report must be submitted through NurtureOhio, available here: [https://progesterone.nurtureohio.com/login.](https://progesterone.nurtureohio.com/login) The report of pregnancy must occur in conjunction with an E&M service and be rendered by a physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant. The payment is paid in addition to the E&M visit.

To access the ROP on the NurtureOhio site, the user needs to have an OH|ID linked to their provider in the PNM. For additional information and NurtureOhio login instructions, review the Provider User Guide here: [https://progesterone.nurtureohio.com/media/PRAFProviderUserGuide10-1-22.pdf.](https://progesterone.nurtureohio.com/media/PRAFProviderUserGuide10-1-22.pdf)

# <span id="page-35-0"></span>**National Drug Code (NDC)**

Federal law requires that any claim detail line for a drug covered by Medicaid must be submitted with the 11-digit NDC assigned to each drug package. The NDC specifically identifies the manufacturer, product and package size. Each NDC is an 11-digit number, sometimes including dashes in the format 55555- 4444-22. When submitting claims to Medicaid, providers should submit each NDC using the 11-digit NDC **without** dashes or spaces. The NDC included on the claim must be the exact NDC that is on the package used by the provider.

Some drug packages include a 10-digit NDC. In this case, the provider should convert the 10 digits to 11 digits when reporting this on the claim. When converting a 10-digit NDC to an 11-digit NDC, a leading zero should be added to only one segment:

- If the first segment contains only four digits, add a leading zero to the segment;
- If the second segment contains only three digits, add a leading zero to the segment;
- If the third segment contains only one digit, add a leading zero to the segment.

All claims reporting NDC information must be submitted either as an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transaction or through the [Provider Network Management \(PNM\) module.](https://ohpnm.omes.maximus.com/OH_PNM_PROD/Account/Login.aspx) The NDC will be required at the detail level when a claim is submitted with a code that represents a drug (e.g., J-codes and Q-codes).

# **Table 2-10: Laboratory Services**

# <span id="page-36-2"></span>**Laboratory Codes**

Community substance use disorder (SUD) treatment providers (provider type 95) with appropriate CLIA certification are provided the laboratory contract. This provides coverage for clinical laboratory services provided on-site if the provider has the appropriate CLIA certificate for the clinical lab services being performed. See ChapMedicaid-11 OAC Chapter 5160-11-11 for Medicaid coverage policies related to laboratory services.

#### **CLIA Certification Overview**

To bill laboratory codes besides those listed above, a provider must obtain the appropriate CLIA certification and enroll as a laboratory Medicaid provider with Ohio Medicaid. ODM must have the CLIA certification on file for the SUD provider to access the appropriate laboratory codes. Once the certificate is uploaded to the PNM, the appropriate laboratory contract will be made available to the SUD agency.

More information on the CLIA certification process can be found at: [https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/odh/home.](https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/odh/home)

# <span id="page-37-0"></span>**Vaccines**

Ohio Medicaid allows BH providers to receive reimbursement for certain vaccines to their adult clients and to children under the Vaccines for Children program, operated by the Ohio Department of Health (ODH). Vaccines are covered when administered at the following places of service: office, inpatient and outpatient residential facilities, in the community, and Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC).

The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program is a federally funded program overseen by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and administered by ODH. More information about the VFC program can be found on [ODH's website](https://odh.ohio.gov/know-our-programs/immunization/vaccines-for-children-vfc) and [CDC's website.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html)

# <span id="page-39-0"></span>Vaccines for Adults

Each year, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) approves immunization schedules recommended for persons living in the United States. The adult immunization schedule provides a summary of ACIP recommendations on the use of licensed vaccines routinely recommended for adults aged 19 years or older. The adult immunization schedule is also approved by the American College of Physicians [\(ACP\)](http://www.acponline.org/), the American Academy of Family Physicians [\(AAFP\)](http://www.aafp.org/), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [\(ACOG\)](http://www.acog.org/), and the American College of Nurse-Midwives [\(ACNM\)](http://www.midwife.org/). **Medicaid may not cover all recommended vaccinations. See Table 2-11 for the list of covered vaccines for behavioral health providers.**

# <span id="page-39-1"></span>**Child and Adolescent Needs Strengths (CANS) Assessment**

The CANS is completed at prescribed intervals or whenever there is a significant change in a member's condition or circumstances. CANS assessors should aim to conduct minimally invasive practice and maintain the best interest of youth/caregivers throughout the assessment process. Accordingly, assessors should not over-assess youth/caregivers or ask them to tell their stories multiple times. The Ohio Children's Initiative CANS assessment and the state CANS IT system supports the practice of building upon what we already know about the youth/caregiver's story and avoiding over-assessment. Prior to engaging the youth/caregiver in the CANS assessment process, the CANS assessors should access the CANS IT System to determine if a recent CANS assessment has been completed with the youth/caregiver. If a recent CANS assessment is available in the CANS IT system, the assessor should use their professional judgment to determine if an update needs to occur or if the most recent assessment can be used.

Requirements for Billing:

- Rendering practitioner must be appropriately certified and trained in the administration of the Ohio Children's Initiative CANS assessment
- The rendering practitioner must have an NPI, be enrolled in Medicaid, add the "ORC" specialty to the individual Ohio Medicaid enrollment and be affiliated with the billing provider (add specialty by sending email request to [MEDICAID\\_PROVIDER\\_UPDATE@medicaid.ohio.gov\)](mailto:MEDICAID_PROVIDER_UPDATE@medicaid.ohio.gov)
- CANS assessments must be entered in Ohio's CANS IT system to establish and maintain OhioRISE eligibility

#### <span id="page-40-0"></span>**Table 2-12: Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) Assessment**

\*For individuals with a primary enrollment in Medicaid as one of the allowable provider types listed in Table 2-12, a practitioner modifier is not required. However, a practitioner modifier (see Table 1-3) may be required if an individual is enrolled with additional specialties and the primary enrollment is not one of the allowable provider types listed in Table 2-12. Please refer to the "Modifiers" worksheet found in the "Dual Licensure Grid" at [bhmedicaid.ohio.gov](https://bh.medicaid.ohio.gov/manuals) for additional information.

The CANS billing Table 2-12 is specific to those services billed by Ohio Medicaid Provider types 84, 95, and OhioRISE Care Management Entities (CME). Other relevant billing providers will follow the claims submission policies consistent with their billing provider type.

Requirements for Billing:

- Addition of the "ORM" specialty to the primary Ohio Medicaid billing provider type
- The rendering practitioner must have an NPI, be enrolled in Medicaid, and be affiliated with the billing provider
- MRSS hourly and 15-minute codes cannot be billed for time spent administering a CANS assessment during an MRSS event

\*For individuals with a primary enrollment in Medicaid as one of the allowable provider types listed in Table 2-13, a practitioner modifier is not required. However, a practitioner modifier (see Table 1-3) may be required if an individual is enrolled with additional specialties and the primary enrollment is not one of the allowable provider types listed in Table 2-13. Please refer to the "Modifiers" worksheet found in the "Dual Licensure Grid" at [bhmedicaid.ohio.gov](https://bh.medicaid.ohio.gov/manuals) for additional information.

\*\* For MRSS providers using an external entity that is not part of the MRSS billing provider agency to support 24/7 coverage, as allowed during an MRSS provider's first year of initial certification, there may be situations where the external entity initiates the crisis response prior to handing off to the MRSS provider. When this occurs, the MRSS provider will use the initial Crisis Mobile Response code S9485 to report services provided during the MRSS team's first encounter with the youth/family after hand-off from the external entity who initiated the crisis response. If the external entity is a Medicaid provider, the external entity may bill for any Medicaid-covered services rendered prior to handing-off to the MRSS team (e.g. psychotherapy for crisis). After the first encounter by the MRSS team reported using the initial Crisis Mobile Response code S9485, subsequent services rendered by the MRSS team during the mobile response phase are billed using the Crisis Mobile Response Follow-up code, S9484.

# **Table 2-14: MRSS Crisis Mobile Response Follow Up**

\*For individuals with a primary enrollment in Medicaid as one of the allowable provider types listed in Table 2-14, a practitioner modifier is not required. However, a practitioner modifier (see Table 1-3) may be required if an individual is enrolled with additional specialties and the primary enrollment is not one of the allowable provider types listed in Table 2-14. Please refer to the "Modifiers" worksheet found in the "Dual Licensure Grid" at [bhmedicaid.ohio.gov](https://bh.medicaid.ohio.gov/manuals) for additional information.

Table 2-14 is specific to Community BH Agency (Ohio Medicaid PT 84 and 95) billing. Hospitals certified to provide this service should use the code set and billing instructions for [Outpatient Hospital](https://medicaid.ohio.gov/resources-for-providers/billing/fee-schedule-and-rates/schedules-and-rates)  [Behavioral Health Services.](https://medicaid.ohio.gov/resources-for-providers/billing/fee-schedule-and-rates/schedules-and-rates)

# <span id="page-86-1"></span><span id="page-86-0"></span>**SECTION 6**

# **Opioid Treatment Programs**

This section includes services provided by Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) licensed by OhioMHAS as a methadone administration program and/or certified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) as an OTP.

# <span id="page-86-2"></span>Provider Network Management (PNM) Enrollment for Opioid Treatment Programs

OTP providers must be enrolled with Ohio Medicaid as provider type 95, community substance use disorder treatment provider, with the 950 provider specialty. Additionally, to bill Medicaid for OTP specialty services, the provider agency must be licensed as an OTP by OhioMHAS and certified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Medicaid OTP provider specialties differ by type:

- Providers of Methadone enroll as Medicaid provider specialty 951.
- Providers of Buprenorphine enroll as Medicaid provider specialty 953.
- Providers of both Methadone and Buprenorphine enroll with both specialties 951 and 953. These specialties can be added by request through the ODM Provider Network Management (PNM) system. OTPs will need to upload their documentation of OhioMHAS licensure and SAMHSA Certification. Once submitted, the request for a new provider specialty and the supporting documentation will be reviewed by ODM Provider Enrollment and the provider will be notified when the specialty is added or if additional information is needed.

### <span id="page-86-3"></span>Buprenorphine Administration for SUD Treatment Programs

# <span id="page-90-0"></span>**Coordination of Benefits: Medicare Opioid Treatment Program Benefit**

ODM is required by CMS to coordinate Medicaid payment for OTP services to individuals with Medicare to ensure services and costs that are covered by the Medicare OTP are not being paid by Medicaid or a Medicaid managed care entity. Based on the Medicare OTP benefit as of the date this manual was

published, Table 6-3 identifies OTP services covered by Medicaid that are included in the Medicare bundled payment, as well as those that are not part of the Medicare bundled payment. Medicaid claims for dually eligible recipients will need to show proof of Medicare denial and valid reason for non-payment prior to Medicaid making any payment for the OTP services that are designated as included in the Medicare bundled payment. The Medicare OTP benefit is subject to change; therefore, Table 6-3 should be used as reference. OTP providers are responsible for billing Medicare prior to Medicaid payers for services that are included in the Medicare OTP bundle.

# **OhioRISE**

The Ohio Department of Medicaid (ODM) supported by the Governor's Family and Children First Cabinet Council, and in partnership with state sister agencies, stakeholders, and providers, developed Ohio's first-ever integrated program to help children who have complex and serious behavioral health needs. OhioRISE (Resilience through Integrated Systems and Excellence), launched on July 1, 2022, aims to improve care and outcomes for these children and their families or caregivers by:

- Creating a seamless delivery system for children and youth, families/caregivers, and system partners.
- Providing a "locus of accountability" by offering community-driven comprehensive care coordination through local Care Management Entities (CMEs).
- Expanding access to critical behavioral health treatment services and supports needed for this population such as Intensive and Moderate Care Coordination, Mobile Response and Stabilization, Behavioral Health Respite, Intensive Home-Based Treatment, and Flexible Funds.
- Assisting youth, families, state, and local child serving agencies, and other health providers to locate and use these services.

The OhioRISE program covers a range of behavioral health (BH) and care coordination services for youth. For more information about billing for services for youth enrolled in OhioRISE, please refer to the [OhioRISE Provider Enrollment and Billing Guidance.](https://www.aetnabetterhealth.com/content/dam/aetna/medicaid/ohio-rise/providers/pdf/abhohiorise_provider_manual.pdf) For youth enrolled in OhioRISE, existing behavioral health services will be covered in accordance with the [OhioRISE Mixed Services Protocol](https://managedcare.medicaid.ohio.gov/wps/wcm/connect/gov/66beb0f3-0b72-482e-8c17-1c981c175842/OHR+Mixed+Services+Protocol.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=o2WaD-Y) and will be billed consistent with the billing policies outlined in the appropriate provider type billing guidelines.
