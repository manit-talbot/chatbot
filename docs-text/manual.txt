## SECTION

## Introduction

The Ohio Department of Medicaid (ODM) created this manual to help providers of community behavioral
health services understand coverage and reimbursement for services provided under the fee-for-service
programs. Medicaid managed care entities (MCEs) also cover services described in this manual.
Providers should refer to the MCE’s billing manual for specific information. For purposes of this manual,
community behavioral health providers are those who are certified by the Ohio Department of Mental
Health and Addiction Services (OhioMHAS) as described in Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) rule 5160-
27-01. The Ohio Administrative Code contains specific regulatory information that is the basis for the
information contained in this manual. Chapter 5160-1 contains regulatory information on the Medicaid
program in general. Additional information is available in the following administrative rule chapters:

- Chapter 5160-1 General Provisions (includes telehealth)
- Chapter 5160-4 Medical and Surgical Services
- Chapter 5160-8 Therapeutic and Diagnostic Services
- Chapter 5160-27 Community Behavioral Health Agency Services
- Chapter 5160-28 Federally Qualified Health Center and Rural Health Clinic Services
- Chapter 5160-43 Specialized Recovery Services Program

## Organization of the Provider Manual

This manual is organized into eight sections.

- Section 1 includes information regarding provider enrollment, rendering provider, supervisor
    requirements, benefit and claims related requirements, and information on fraud, waste and abuse.
- Section 2 is dedicated to medical and behavioral health services that can be provided by both
    mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) agencies.
- Section 3 provides specific service requirements and claims billing information for services
    which can only be performed by mental health agencies. This section includes evidence-based
    practices.
- Section 4 provides specific service requirements and claims billing information for services
    which can only be performed by SUD outpatient agencies.
- Section 5 provides specific service requirements and claims billing information for services
    which can only be performed by SUD residential agencies.
- Section 6 provides information on Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs).
- Section 7 provides information on the Specialized Recovery Services (SRS) program and related
    resources.
- Section 8 provides information on OhioRISE (Resilience through Integrated Systems and
    Excellence), a program to help children who have complex and serious behavioral health needs.

## Provider Enrollment – OhioMHAS-certified providers (organizations)

To participate in the Ohio Medicaid program, including contracting with the managed care entities,
OhioMHAS-certified providers must enroll in the Ohio Medicaid program. All provider enrollment
applications must be submitted using Ohio Medicaid’s Provider Network Management (PNM) module.
The PNM module is the single point for providers to complete provider enrollment, centralized
credentialing, and provider self-service. For more information about the PNM please visit
[http://www.managedcare.medicaid.ohio.gov/managed-care/centralized-credentialing.](http://www.managedcare.medicaid.ohio.gov/managed-care/centralized-credentialing.)


## Provider Type 84 or

Prior to enrollment in the Ohio Medicaid program, a provider must be certified by OhioMHAS as a
provider of behavioral health (BH) services. Information on OhioMHAS’s service certification can be
obtained from the OhioMHAS Bureau of Licensure & Certification by calling 614-752-8880 or by
visiting the OhioMHAS licensure and certification webpage here: Licensure & Certification | Department
of Mental Health and Addiction Services (ohio.gov).

Once certified by OhioMHAS as a BH service provider, an online application or applications for
enrollment in the Ohio Medicaid program must be submitted using the PNM module. There are two
provider types associated with behavioral health benefits; provider type 84 is used for accessing the
mental health benefit while provider type 95 is used for accessing the substance use disorder benefit.
Organizations that will be providing both benefits will need to enroll as **BOTH** provider types. There may
be an application fee for applying as provider type 84 and/or 95. During the enrollment process, a
provider specialty will need to be selected for each provider type. ODM will add or change specialties as
necessary based upon the OhioMHAS/SAMHSA certification(s) and/or OhioMHAS licensure
documentation received with the application.

https://managedcare.medicaid.ohio.gov/managed-care/centralized-credentialing/about-pnm

## Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Clinics (RHCs)

FQHCs and RHCs may be certified by OhioMHAS for the provision of community behavioral health
services by enrolling as a provider type 84 and/or 95. OAC Rule 5160-28-03 describes requirements for
FQHC and RHC services, including services that are considered FQHC and RHC Prospective Payment
System (PPS) services. For OhioMHAS-certified providers who are also FQHCs or RHCs, behavioral
health services that are not FQHC or RHC PPS services are covered under OAC Chapter 27 and may be
billed under their Ohio Medicaid Provider type 84 or 95 enrollment and will be paid in accordance with
OAC Chapter 27 as described in this manual.

## Out of State MH/SUD Providers

Pursuant to Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) rule 5160-27-01, MH and/or SUD agencies/programs
operating outside of the state of Ohio must be recognized (regulated) in the state in which it operates as a
provider of community-based MH and/or SUD services. That documentation must be submitted along
with the organization’s Medicaid provider application.

## Rendering Practitioners

ODM requires that the rendering practitioner for behavioral health services be listed on claims submitted
to Ohio Medicaid for payment. Their personal NPI must be reported in the rendering field on the claim
for each service they provide.

All rendering practitioners are required to have a National Provider Identifier (NPI) to render services to
Medicaid enrollees AND they will be required to enroll in the Ohio Medicaid program and affiliate with
their employing/contracting agency. An NPI can be obtained by visiting
https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/NPPES.

Once the provider has obtained an NPI, they must visit the PNM and enroll as a provider in the Ohio
Medicaid Program. More details on this process are available at:
https://managedcare.medicaid.ohio.gov/managed-care/centralized-credentialing/about-pnm


## Paraprofessionals

Paraprofessionals (practitioners without a professional license) may render some mental health and/or
SUD services. They must enroll in Ohio Medicaid following the instructions above. The provider type in
Ohio’s PNM system is “96”. Paraprofessionals may select more than one specialty. For example, one
could enroll as a Qualified Mental Health Specialist (QMHS) and may also enroll as a Care Management
Specialist (CMS) by selecting specialties 960 (QMHS) and 962 (CMS).

If a QMHS or CMS practitioner obtains additional educational credentials or years of experience after
their initial enrollment, the employing/contracting agency should provide documentation of the
educational credential or experience by submitting a provider update to the ODM Provider Enrollment
mailbox: medicaid_provider_update@medicaid.ohio.gov. Once the documentation has been received and
approved, the provider’s enrollment status will be updated to match. (See more information below about
QMHS, CMS and Certified Peer Supporters ).

## Multi-licensed Practitioners

ODM recognizes that some individuals may hold more than one (1) license or an assistant/trainee
credential with differing scopes of practice. In order to allow these practitioners to operate under the
scope of multiple professional credentials, ODM is allowing these practitioners to add a multi-license
specialty. This multi-license specialty will allow the practitioner to render services available under their
second license or credential. Please refer to the Dual Licensure Grid located at
https://medicaid.ohio.gov/resources-for-providers/bh/manuals under the Billing Resources section.

To enroll with multi-license specialty:
If a practitioner has more than one credential/paraprofessional recognition, please include a comment in
the Notes section of the enrollment application indicating what additional credential/paraprofessional
recognition is held. Paraprofessionals can select a primary, a secondary or multiple secondary specialty.
Be certain to upload the necessary documentation for each license/certificate. If already enrolled with
ODM, email medicaid_provider_update@medicaid.ohio.gov with necessary information to support the
second specialty.

Claim submission:

- **Reporting additional licensure on claims** - Practitioners with the multi‐licensed practitioner
    specialty submit claims as follows:
       o For their original license according to information found elsewhere in this manual:
          rendering NPI, applicable procedure modifiers, etc.
       o For services under their additional license(s), the claims will require an additional
          modifier to reflect under what additional license they are operating.
       o For example, a person enrolled with ODM as an RN who is also an LPCC must have the
          UH modifier **in addition to their individual practitioner NPI** on the detail line of the
          claim in order for ODM’s claims payment system to recognize this practitioner as an
          allowable renderer of the service.

See the “Modifiers” tab on the Dual Licensure Grid referenced above.

## Overview of Supervision

```
Ohio Medicaid covers services provided by practitioners who, under state licensing, require supervision.
The types of practitioners who may supervise are determined according to the appropriate licensing
boards.
```
```
General supervision: The supervising practitioner must be available by telephone to provide assistance
and direction if needed.
```
```
Direct supervision: The supervising practitioner must be “immediately available” and “interruptible” to
provide assistance and direction throughout the performance of the procedure; however, he or she does
not need to be present in the room when the procedure is performed.
```
```
Ohio Medicaid requires the following practitioners to practice under either direct or general supervision.
Reporting the supervising NPI on the claim is optional. For those practitioners listed below with direct
supervision, the service will be paid at direct supervisor’s rate when supervisor NPI is included in the
header of the claim. If the supervisor NPI is not included on the claim indicating the service is provided
under general supervision, the service will be paid at 72.25% of maximum fee.
```

```
Practitioners requiring supervision must have supervision available to them at all times, including
supervisor sick days, trainings, vacations, etc. Each licensing board regulates supervision requirements for
their provider types and may have specific requirements pertaining to supervisor coverage during
absences. In the absence of board guidance on supervisor coverage, Ohio Medicaid does not require
practitioners to be assigned to a specific supervisor, therefore, any qualified supervising practitioner
permitted by the practitioner’s respective licensing board’s OAC may provide coverage during absences
but must assume all supervision responsibilities, including signing off on services provided. The
following websites contain further guidance on supervision:

```
*This is a brief overview concerning licensure and scope of practice. It is each agency or provider’s
responsibility to understand the laws, rules, and requirements applicable to their licensure and scope of
practice.
```
## Incident to Services

```
The term “incident to” refers to the services or supplies that are a key part of the physician’s personal
professional services in the course of diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury. In plain language:
under the “incident to” provision of Medicare, services are submitted under the physician’s NPI but are
actually performed by someone else. There are restrictions on the types of services that ancillary
personnel may perform under this provision. Ohio Medicaid follows the CMS guidelines on “incident to”
services. More information is available in The “Incident To” Provision of Medicare Fact Sheet.
```
```
Additional Resources for CMS “incident to” billing information:
```
- Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15 Section 60.
- CMS Medicare Learning Network Articles


## Practitioner Modifiers

```
In order to communicate detailed information in an efficient, standardized way, modifiers are two-
character suffixes that healthcare providers or coders attach to a CPT or HCPCS code to provide
additional information about the practitioner or procedure. It is extremely important to accurately report
modifiers as they are used to count towards soft limits, price services, and adjudicate claims
appropriately. Modifiers are always two characters in length. They may consist of two numbers, two
let ters, or a combination of a letter and a number (alphanumeric). Ohio Medicaid will accept modifiers in
any order, however, modifier fields on the claim must be populated in order from one to four (the first
modifier field must be populated before the second modifier field, etc.).

## Place of Service (POS)

Providers must accurately identify and report on each claim detail line where a service took place using
the most appropriate CMS place of service code. Each billing chart in this manual will list the place of
service codes covered by Medicaid.

**“Other Place of Service” Setting**

Place of service “99-Other Place of Service” has been redefined for Ohio Medicaid as “Community”. See
this manual’s Appendix for a more complete definition of this and other places of service.

## Claims Detail Rollup for Same Day Services

When the same service is rendered to the same client by the same practitioner at more than one time
during the same day, those services should be “rolled up” into a single detail line on a claim. However, if
anything differs except the time the service was rendered, the claims should be reported separately.
Services that need to be rolled must be rolled by the same date of service, same client, same HCPCS code,
same modifier(s), same individual rendering practitioner NPI, same supervisor NPI, and same place of
service. Services that are not appropriately rolled up may result in a denial for duplicate services.

**Example 1** : Amy Smith, RN renders TBS to a client in the office in the morning and then again in the
office later that afternoon. This is acceptable to roll up the two patient contacts into the same claim line
because there is the same service, the same rendering practitioner, the same client, and the same place of
service.

**Example 2:** Amy Smith, RN renders TBS to a client in the office in the morning and then again in the
client’s home later that afternoon. The services should be reported on separate detail lines with
appropriate place of service identifying home or office.

## Third Party Payer (TPP) Coordination of Benefits (COB)

Coordination of benefits is the process of determining the payment obligations of each health plan,
insurance policy, or third-party resource when two or more resources cover the same benefits for a
Medicaid recipient. Coordination of benefits is a federal requirement set forth in 42 CFR 433 Subpart D
and includes specific activities for state Medicaid agencies related to third-party liability (TPL).
Medicaid, or a Medicaid Managed Care Entity (MCE) must be the payer of last resort, except as allowed
in OAC rules 5160-1-08 and 5160-26-09.1.

After a provider has gone through all reasonable measures to obtain all third-party payments as described
in OAC rules 5160-1-08 and 5160-26-09.1 a claim may be submitted to ODM/MCEs requesting
reimbursement for the rendered service(s). Providers who have received a zero payment from a third-
party payer (TPP) or a partial payment will need to use the appropriate claim adjustment reason codes
(CARCs) from the primary’s Explanation of Benefits (EOB) on the claim submission to ODM/MCEs.

ODM maintains a list of specific service procedure codes or combinations of procedure codes and
rendering providers that are covered by Ohio Medicaid but are not generally covered by commercial
payers or Medicare. This list, known as the _Medicare and TPL list_ is located at
https://medicaid.ohio.gov/resources-for-providers/bh/manuals under _Billing Resources/Medicare and TPL
Bypass list_. The list is separated into three sections – Medicare, Medicare Opioid Treatment Program
(OTP), and TPL Bypass (for commercial payers).


- The Medicare list includes procedure codes and procedures code/rendering provider type
    combinations not covered by Medicare. The Medicare OTP list is only applicable to opioid
    treatment providers serving individuals with Medicare coverage.
- The TPL Bypass list is applicable to other payers (other than Medicare or Medicaid payers).
For the procedure codes on each of these payer lists, respectively, the provider may “bypass” the
requirement to first bill the Third Party Payer (commercial or Medicare payer) and submit the claim
directly to Medicaid.

The _Medicare and TPL Bypass List_ was created to allow payment for certain services ODM identified
that are not typically covered by TPPs. However, if TPP coverage is later discovered through ODM’s or
an MCE’s post payment recovery process, payment may be recouped in accordance with federal
Medicaid requirements. Therefore, if a provider is unsure of a specific TPP’s coverage policy for any of
the services or procedure codes, the provider should confirm coverage prior to billing for the service
directly to Medicaid to avoid a future recoupment. , The Bypass List will be periodically updated to
account for Medicare and commercial insurance coverage changes.

The _Medicare and TPL Bypass List_ only applies to claims submitted by Medicaid provider types 84
(Community Mental Health Agencies) and 95 (Substance Use Disorder Treatment Providers). ODM
recommends:

- BH providers require individuals to provide TPP information at the time of service as a best
    practice.
- BH providers should use the Electronic Data Interchange 270/271 eligibility transaction, check
    the payer portal, and exhaust any other sources for any TPP information on file, prior to
    submitting a claim to Medicaid.
- BH providers are required to bill the TPP prior to billing Medicaid for all services except for the
    service procedure codes listed on the _BH Medicare and TPL Bypass List_.
- BH providers should always notify ODM when they identify incorrect TPL information.

## Benefits and Prior Authorization

In the behavioral health benefit package, there are services and/or levels of care that are subject to prior
authorization. Table 1-5 summarizes those services/levels of care and their associated prior authorization
policy. Certain services may have prior authorization requirements when provided on the same day as
other services. Please refer to OAC Chapter 5160-27 and rule 5160-8-05 for service-specific
requirements.

a fee for service prior authorization request for a behavioral health service is available at
[http://bh.medicaid.ohio.gov/training.](http://bh.medicaid.ohio.gov/training.) Information regarding prior authorization requests for Medicaid
clients enrolled with a managed care or MyCare Ohio entity can be found in the Medicaid Managed Care
Plan Resource Guide.

Requirements for medical necessity are found here: OAC 5160-1-01

## Non-Covered Services

Non-covered services are described in OAC rules 5160-1-61 and 5160-27-02. Additionally, Ohio
Medicaid does not cover services to individuals who meet the criteria described in OAC rule 5160:1-1-03.
A missed appointment is considered a non-service and is not reimbursable by Ohio Medicaid as described
in OAC rule 5160-1-13.1.

## Fraud, Waste, and Abuse

OAC rule 5160-1-29 sets forth the Ohio Medicaid policy on Medicaid Fraud, Waste, and Abuse. Under
the Ohio Medicaid provider agreement, providers are required to comply with the terms of the agreement,
Ohio Revised Code, Administrative Code, and federal statutes and rules. In Ohio, the Attorney General is
authorized under ORC 109.85 to create a Medicaid Fraud and Control Unit (MFCU) for investigating and
prosecuting Medicaid provider fraud in Ohio. Additional information regarding Ohio’s Medicaid Fraud
Control unit can be found on their website, Health Care Fraud - Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost.


## Review of Provider Records

OAC rule 5160-1-27 sets forth the Ohio Medicaid policy on Review of Provider Records. Please review
this rule for more information about Ohio Medicaid audit and review activities.

## Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM)

The CMS Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) program measures and reports improper payments
in Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Please visit CMS’s PERM website for
more information.

## Medicaid National Correct Coding Initiative

The National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) was established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS) to promote national correct coding methodologies with the goal to reduce improper
coding that results in inappropriate payments for both Medicare and Medicaid. A complete and up-to-date
list of NCCI edits can be found at https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-integrity/national-
correct-coding-initiative/medicaid-ncci-edit-files/index.html. These edits are updated quarterly.

NCCI procedure-to-procedure (PTP) edits and medically unlikely edits (MUEs) are only applicable to a
single provider to a single individual on the same date of service. NCCI contains two types of edits:

## NCCI Procedure-To-Procedure (PTP) Edits

PTP edits define pairs of Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) / Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) codes that should not be reported together for a variety of reasons. The purpose of the
PTP edits is to prevent improper payments when incorrect code combinations are reported.

**Example 1** : The same physician performs a psychotherapy service and Evaluation and Management
(E&M) service on the same day for the same client (significant and separately identifiable services).
NCCI will not allow the psychotherapy code 90834 to be billed with an E&M office visit code 99212, as
there are separate add-on codes (+90833, +90836, and +90838) for psychotherapy services provided in
conjunction with E&M services.

**Example 2:** A qualified practitioner working for ABC Behavioral Health Agency renders 90791, a
psychiatric diagnostic assessment, for a client. On the same day, the same client receives an “evaluation
and management” primary care service (e.g. 99202-99205) rendered by another qualified practitioner
working for ABC Behavioral Health Agency. According to the NCCI practitioner to practitioner (PTP)
edit guidance, this is acceptable because in this scenario, the services were rendered by two different
rendering practitioners. The NCCI PTP edits apply only to the same practitioner.

Medicaid PTP, MUE edits, and other relevant information can be found at:
https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-integrity/ncci/edit-files/index.html.

For PTP edits that have a Correct Coding Modifier Indicator (CCMI) of “0,” the codes should never be
reported together by the same provider for the same individual on the same date of service. If they are
reported on the same date of service, the column one code is eligible for payment and the column two
code is denied.

For PTP edits that have a CCMI of “1,” the codes may be reported together only in defined circumstances
which are identified on the claim by the use of specific NCCI-associated modifiers. Where services are


“separate and distinct,” it may be necessary to override the procedure-to-procedure edit using a specific
modifier:

- XE – “Separate encounter, A service that is distinct because it occurred during a separate
    encounter” (This modifier should only be used to describe separate encounters on the same date
    of service).
- XS – “Separate Structure, A service that is distinct because it was performed on a separate
    organ/structure.”
- XP – “Separate Practitioner, A service that is distinct because it was performed by a different
    practitioner.”
- XU – “Unusual Non-Overlapping Service, The use of a service that is distinct because it does not
    overlap usual components of the main service.”

Documentation must support a different session, different procedure or surgery, different site or organ
system, separate incision/excision, separate lesion, or separate injury (or area of injury in extensive
injuries) not ordinarily encountered or performed on the same day by the same individual. However,
when another already established modifier is appropriate, it should be used rather than modifier 59.
Modifier 59 should only be utilized if no other more specific modifier is appropriate.

## Medically Unlikely Edits (MUEs)

MUEs define for each HCPCS / CPT code the maximum units of service (UOS) that a provider would
report under most circumstances for a single individual on a single date of service. **MUEs cannot be
overridden with the 59, XE, XS, XP, XU modifiers.**

Example 1: The same physician performs two diagnostic evaluations (2 units of 90791) to the same client
on the same day. NCCI will deny the second evaluation, as it is medically unlikely that one client would
need two complete diagnostic evaluations in the same day.

There is extensive guidance regarding Medicaid agencies and national correct coding available at The
National Correct Coding Initiative in Medicaid.


## Time-Based CPT Codes

When billing time-based codes, the CPT/HCPCS time rule applies, unless otherwise specified: For the
minimum billable service of the code, divide the time by two and add one minute in order to determine if
that code can be billed. For example; 90832 = 30 minutes, therefore the minimum length of service must
be 16 minutes (30/2 = 15 then 15 + 1 = 16) in order for the service to be billable.

## Prolonged Services

Effective January 1, 2023, the American Medical Association (AMA) discontinued prolonged service
codes 99354 and 99355 for use with psychotherapy codes. ODM and MCE billing systems were updated
to reflect this change. Providers should refer to AMA and National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI)
guidance with regard to billing psychotherapy codes for dates of service on or after January 1, 2023.

Effective January 1, 2022, ODM adopted for Medicaid community behavioral health providers the use of
AMA procedure codes of 99415 and 99416 to indicate prolonged E&M services. Providers should refer to
the CPT manual for additional information about appropriate use of codes 99415 and 99416.

Also effective January 1, 2022, ODM’s claims payment system was updated to follow NCCI Procedure to
Procedure (PTP) edits to not allow the use of 99354 and 99355 with E&M codes 99202-99205 and
99211-99215.

Providers serving individuals with primary insurance coverage other than Medicaid are advised to follow
billing guidance for the primary payer when determining which prolonged services code to use before
submitting to Medicaid for secondary payment.

For more information regarding prolonged services codes, please review the prolonged services section of
the latest edition of the CPT manual. The CPT website can be found here.


## SECTION

## Behavioral Health Services

```
For behavioral health billing, CPT service codes consist of E&M office visits, psychotherapy, psychiatric
diagnostic evaluations, psychiatric testing, and appropriate add-on codes. The American Medical
Association (AMA) publishes annual CPT reference books, which provide the CPT l codes, their
associated descriptions, and guidance on appropriate use, including use of add-on codes. Please note,
providers are responsible for utilizing the appropriate AMA and/or CMS guidance for documentation and
billing. Therefore, it is recommended that all providers obtain a copy of a current CPT manual and, for
those providers/practitioners that participate in the Original Medicare program, the most current guidance
is available through the Medicare Learning Network (MLN). This section also includes billing guidance
for HCPCS codes that are also available to both MH and SUD agencies. Practitioner abbreviations are
used in the service tables provided in the remaining sections of this manual. The Practitioner
Abbreviations Key below may be used as a reference to these abbreviations.

```
## National Drug Code (NDC)

```
Federal law requires that any claim detail line for a drug covered by Medicaid must be submitted with the
11-digit NDC assigned to each drug package. The NDC specifically identifies the manufacturer, product
and package size. Each NDC is an 11-digit number, sometimes including dashes in the format 55555-
4444-22. When submitting claims to Medicaid, providers should submit each NDC using the 11-digit
NDC without dashes or spaces. The NDC included on the claim must be the exact NDC that is on the
package used by the provider.
```
```
Some drug packages include a 10-digit NDC. In this case, the provider should convert the 10 digits to 11
digits when reporting this on the claim. When converting a 10-digit NDC to an 11-digit NDC, a leading
zero should be added to only one segment:
```
- If the first segment contains only four digits, add a leading zero to the segment;
- If the second segment contains only three digits, add a leading zero to the segment;
- If the third segment contains only one digit, add a leading zero to the segment.
All claims reporting NDC information must be submitted either as an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
transaction or through the Provider Network Management (PNM) module. The NDC will be required at
the detail level when a claim is submitted with a code that represents a drug (e.g., J-codes and Q-codes).

## Laboratory Codes

```
Community substance use disorder (SUD) treatment providers (provider type 95) with appropriate CLIA
certification are provided the laboratory contract. This provides coverage for clinical laboratory services
provided on-site if the provider has the appropriate CLIA certificate for the clinical lab services being
performed. See ChapMedicaid-11 OAC Chapter 5160-11-11 for Medicaid coverage policies related to
laboratory services.
```
```
CLIA Certification Overview
To bill laboratory codes besides those listed above, a provider must obtain the appropriate CLIA
certification and enroll as a laboratory Medicaid provider with Ohio Medicaid. ODM must have the CLIA
certification on file for the SUD provider to access the appropriate laboratory codes. Once the certificate
is uploaded to the PNM, the appropriate laboratory contract will be made available to the SUD agency.
```
```
More information on the CLIA certification process can be found at:
https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/odh/home.
```

## Vaccines

```
Ohio Medicaid allows BH providers to receive reimbursement for certain vaccines to their adult clients
and to children under the Vaccines for Children program, operated by the Ohio Department of Health
(ODH). Vaccines are covered when administered at the following places of service: office, inpatient and
outpatient residential facilities, in the community, and Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC).
```
```
The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program is a federally funded program overseen by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and administered by ODH. More information about the VFC
program can be found on ODH’s website and CDC’s website.

information about the program and eligibility criteria for children visit the ODH website resources here:
```
- Vaccines for Children (VFC) | Ohio Department of Health
- ODH VFC FAQs


## Vaccines for Adults

Each year, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) approves immunization schedules
recommended for persons living in the United States. The adult immunization schedule provides a
summary of ACIP recommendations on the use of licensed vaccines routinely recommended for adults
aged 19 years or older. The adult immunization schedule is also approved by the American College of
Physicians (ACP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM).
**Medicaid may not cover all recommended vaccinations. See Table 2-11 for the list of covered
vaccines for behavioral health providers.**

## Child and Adolescent Needs Strengths (CANS) Assessment

The CANS is completed at prescribed intervals or whenever there is a significant change in a member's
condition or circumstances. CANS assessors should aim to conduct minimally invasive practice and
maintain the best interest of youth/caregivers throughout the assessment process. Accordingly, assessors
should not over-assess youth/caregivers or ask them to tell their stories multiple times. The Ohio
Children’s Initiative CANS assessment and the state CANS IT system supports the practice of building
upon what we already know about the youth/caregiver’s story and avoiding over-assessment. Prior to
engaging the youth/caregiver in the CANS assessment process, the CANS assessors should access the
CANS IT System to determine if a recent CANS assessment has been completed with the
youth/caregiver. If a recent CANS assessment is available in the CANS IT system, the assessor should
use their professional judgment to determine if an update needs to occur or if the most recent assessment
can be used.

Requirements for Billing:

- Rendering practitioner must be appropriately certified and trained in the administration of the
    Ohio Children’s Initiative CANS assessment
- The rendering practitioner must have an NPI, be enrolled in Medicaid, add the “ORC” specialty
    to the individual Ohio Medicaid enrollment and be affiliated with the billing provider (add
    specialty by sending email request to MEDICAID_PROVIDER_UPDATE@medicaid.ohio.gov)
- CANS assessments must be entered in Ohio’s CANS IT system to establish and maintain
    OhioRISE eligibility

```

** For MRSS providers using an external entity that is not part of the MRSS billing provider agency to
support 24/7 coverage, as allowed during an MRSS provider’s first year of initial certification, there may
be situations where the external entity initiates the crisis response prior to handing off to the MRSS
provider. When this occurs, the MRSS provider will use the initial Crisis Mobile Response code S9485 to
report services provided during the MRSS team’s first encounter with the youth/family after hand-off
from the external entity who initiated the crisis response. If the external entity is a Medicaid provider, the
external entity may bill for any Medicaid-covered services rendered prior to handing-off to the MRSS
team (e.g. psychotherapy for crisis). After the first encounter by the MRSS team reported using the initial
Crisis Mobile Response code S9485, subsequent services rendered by the MRSS team during the mobile
response phase are billed using the Crisis Mobile Response Follow-up code, S9484.

## SECTION

## Opioid Treatment Programs

This section includes services provided by Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) licensed by OhioMHAS
as a methadone administration program and/or certified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA) as an OTP.

## Provider Network Management (PNM) Enrollment for Opioid Treatment Programs

OTP providers must be enrolled with Ohio Medicaid as provider type 95, community substance use
disorder treatment provider, with the 950 provider specialty. Additionally, to bill Medicaid for OTP
specialty services, the provider agency must be licensed as an OTP by OhioMHAS and certified by the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Medicaid OTP provider
specialties differ by type:

- Providers of Methadone enroll as Medicaid provider specialty 951.
- Providers of Buprenorphine enroll as Medicaid provider specialty 953.
- Providers of both Methadone and Buprenorphine enroll with both specialties 951 and 953.
These specialties can be added by request through the ODM Provider Network Management (PNM)
system. OTPs will need to upload their documentation of OhioMHAS licensure and SAMHSA
Certification. Once submitted, the request for a new provider specialty and the supporting
documentation will be reviewed by ODM Provider Enrollment and the provider will be notified when
the specialty is added or if additional information is needed.

## Buprenorphine Administration for SUD Treatment Programs

For information on billing for Buprenorphine administration, refer to Table 2-9 : Provider Administered

    including single take home doses provided in accordance with Ohio Administrative Code
    5122-40-06.
       a. If a patient is seen every day in order to receive methadone or buprenorphine,
          modifier HF must be used with H0020 and T1502 respectively.
       b. The date of service for H0020 or T1502 with modifier HF is the date of
          administration of the medication or in the case of a daily take-home dose, the
          date the patient will take the dose.
2. **Weekly Administration.** H0020 or T1502 with a modifier representing 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks
    (see Table 6-1) is used for weekly medication administration that includes take-home doses
    provided in accordance with 42 Ohio Administrative Code 5122-40-06. The OTP must
    maintain documentation in the patient record that supports the number of take-home doses
    administered.
       a. If any weekly administration modifier has been billed, the OTP cannot bill H0020
          or T1502 again during that time period (1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks).
       b. Date of service on the claim must be the date the patient was seen in the office
          by the OTP in order to receive their take-home medication.


3. OTPs administering buprenorphine must bill the appropriate J code (see Table 6-2) for

    license.
8. OTPs may bill for the collection of blood using venipuncture (36415), per draw when the

## Coordination of Benefits: Medicare Opioid Treatment Program Benefit

```
ODM is required by CMS to coordinate Medicaid payment for OTP services to individuals with Medicare
to ensure services and costs that are covered by the Medicare OTP are not being paid by Medicaid or a
Medicaid managed care entity. Based on the Medicare OTP benefit as of the date this manual was
```

published, Table 6-3 identifies OTP services covered by Medicaid that are included in the Medicare
bundled payment, as well as those that are not part of the Medicare bundled payment. Medicaid claims for
dually eligible recipients will need to show proof of Medicare denial and valid reason for non-payment
prior to Medicaid making any payment for the OTP services that are designated as included in the
Medicare bundled payment. The Medicare OTP benefit is subject to change; therefore, Table 6-3 should
be used as reference. OTP providers are responsible for billing Medicare prior to Medicaid payers for
services that are included in the Medicare OTP bundle.

## SECTION

## OhioRISE

The Ohio Department of Medicaid (ODM) supported by the Governor’s Family and Children First
Cabinet Council, and in partnership with state sister agencies, stakeholders, and providers, developed
Ohio’s first-ever integrated program to help children who have complex and serious behavioral health
needs. OhioRISE (Resilience through Integrated Systems and Excellence), launched on July 1, 2022, aims
to improve care and outcomes for these children and their families or caregivers by:

- Creating a seamless delivery system for children and youth, families/caregivers, and system
    partners.
- Providing a “locus of accountability” by offering community-driven comprehensive care
    coordination through local Care Management Entities (CMEs).
- Expanding access to critical behavioral health treatment services and supports needed for this
    population such as Intensive and Moderate Care Coordination, Mobile Response and
    Stabilization, Behavioral Health Respite, Intensive Home-Based Treatment, and Flexible
    Funds.
- Assisting youth, families, state, and local child serving agencies, and other health providers to
    locate and use these services.

The OhioRISE program covers a range of behavioral health (BH) and care coordination services for
youth. For more information about billing for services for youth enrolled in OhioRISE, please refer to the
OhioRISE Provider Enrollment and Billing Guidance. For youth enrolled in OhioRISE, existing
behavioral health services will be covered in accordance with the OhioRISE Mixed Services Protocol and
will be billed consistent with the billing policies outlined in the appropriate provider type billing
guidelines.
